Spotify Party Playlist App

To-Do:
1) Make necessary changes to index.html (homepage) like the text and the background
2) Create page for "making a new party"
3) Create page for "find a party" search results
4) Create page for searching for new songs
5) Create page to sign into Spotify Account
6) Figure out a way to generate a unique ID (shouldn't be primary key because it would be easy for someone to guess/hack)


Methods to implement:
1) Sign into/link with Spotify Account
2) Search our own database for party using unique code
3) Search Spotify database for songs
4) Add songs to playlist
5) (if we have time) Remove songs from playlist


Database Schema:
id, primary key, auto increment.
unique ID
name of Party Master
party name (maybe?)
credentials of Party Master's Spotify account?
